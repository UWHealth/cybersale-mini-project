For potential front end candidates

#Instructions
You're given three .png mockups for three different states of a responsive webpage. This is an actual web app, Cybersale, that we built using Java. We need you to convert the mockups to one responsive page that matches the three designs at the designated pixel breakpoints. Feel free to use a responsive framework of your choice, or just do it from scratch.  Extra points if you throw in cool UI extras and JavaScript, but we're only requesting the bare minimum. If you need more direction or have other questions, don't hesitate to ask.
